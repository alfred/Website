These are the files I use on my website.

My current idea now, is to have a consistent top bar and background. Basically what Brendan has now, except I'd have a welcome page with my picture.

Welcome Page - Picture of me on the left and a short but descriptive paragraph containing the purpose of the site.

About - Page long about me kinda thing.

Projects - List of projects, each with a summary 

Links to showcase my internet identity

Contact info - Emails, Phone number
